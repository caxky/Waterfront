                    Everyone feels good about contributing to a larger cause and doing something selfless, 
                    especially if those outcomes align with the delivery of solid results and success for you.

                    Leading with compassion has great merits since it allows us to perceive 
                    things from another individualâ€™s perspective and be able to leverage that information for good.

                    By being open-minded rather than impressing what we might want for you, 
                    new ideas will flow and the end goals will tell you what it needs.
